The 'GeneSelection-GeneExpressionData' file contains algorithms for data preprocessing, recurrent neural networks, and feature selection, which are used in gene expression data to select a subset of genes due to the high dimensionality of these types of data.

The 'Projeto' file contains algorithms for data preprocessing, feature selection using K-Means, machine learning with KNN, and visualization in high-dimensional gene expression data.

The 'Seminario' file contains algorithms for data preprocessing, recurrent neural networks, and data augmentation in natural language processing.
