The "GeneSelection-GeneExpressionData" file has algorithms for data-preprocessing, Recurrent Neural Networks and feature selection which using in gene expression data selects a subset of genes due to the high-dimensionality these types of data.

The "Projeto" file has algorithms for data-preprocessing, feature selection with K-Means, machine learning with KNN and visualization in high-dimensional gene expression data.

The "seminario" file has algorithms for data-preprocessing, Recurrent Neural Networks and data-augmentation in natural language processing.
